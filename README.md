<h1 align="center">Showdown App</h1>

A web application for schools and organizations to organize their team rosters for various competitions and games--football, soccer, basketball, volleyball, dodgeball, and knowledge bowl.

Schools are able to register their schools and submit rosters based on their desired competition. Users are also able to register and display their names on a universal list so that others can see who is registered for Showdown. 

HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript are used for the front-end while Python is mostly use for the back-end. Bcrypt was used to authenticate users. The 7timer weather api was used to get local weather information at the the host school, UTSA.
